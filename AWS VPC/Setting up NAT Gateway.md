#### Step 1: Create the Infra VPC
```xml
Name: Infra-VPC in US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1
CIDR : 10.70.0.0/16
```
#### Step 2: Create a 2 public subnets with
```xml
CIDR :10.70.8.0/21
Name: Infra-public-subnet-1a

CIDR :10.70.16.0/21
Name: Infra-public-subnet-1b

```
#### Step 3: Create a 2 private subnets with
```xml
CIDR :10.70.80.0/21
Name: Infra-private-subnet-1a

CIDR :10.70.88.0/21
Name: Infra-private-subnet-1b

```

#### Step 4: Create a 2 app subnets with
```xml
CIDR :10.70.144.0/21
Name: Infra-app-subnet-1a

CIDR :10.70.162.0/21
Name: Infra-app-subnet-1b

```
#### Step 5: Create a 2 data subnets with
```xml
CIDR :10.70.168.0/21
Name: Infra-data-subnet-1a

CIDR :10.70.176.0/21
Name: Infra-data-subnet-1b

```

#### Step 6: Create an internet gateway and attach to Infra VPC
```xml
Name: Infra-VPC-IGW
```
#### Step 7: Create a route table and name it Infra-VPC-Public-RouteTable and attach the public subnets to this RouteTable.
```xml
Name: Infra-Public-RouteTable
```

#### Step 8: Create a route table and name it Infra-Private-RouteTable-us-east-1a, then attach the private, app, and data subnets in Availability Zone us-east-1a to this route table.

```xml
Name: Infra-Private-RouteTable-us-east-1a
```

#### Step 9: Create a route table and name it Infra-Private-RouteTable-us-east-1b, then attach the private, app, and data subnets in Availability Zone us-east-1b to this route table.

```xml
Name: Infra-Private-RouteTable-us-east-1b
```

#### Step 10: Add the Internet Gateway route to the Infra-Public-RouteTable

```xml
Route Entry

Destination : 0.0.0.0/0
Target : Internet Gateway ID
```
#### Step 11: Create and Add the Infra-Nat-Gateway-us-east-1a NAT Gateway route to the Infra-Private-RouteTable-us-east-1a route table.

```xml
Route Entry

Destination : 0.0.0.0/0
Target : NAT Gateway ID
```

#### Step 12: Create and Add the Infra-Nat-Gateway-us-east-1b NAT Gateway route to the Infra-Private-RouteTable-us-east-1b route table.

```xml
Route Entry

Destination : 0.0.0.0/0
Target : NAT Gateway ID
```
## Step 13: Launch the Linux EC2 instance in the Private Subnet.
## Step 14: SSH into the Linux EC2 instance using the private IP address from the public instance (Bastion Host).
+ Note: Once connected to the instance, try to ping an external IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8) or access the internet by using commands like "ping," "curl," or "wget." If the NAT Gateway is configured correctly, you should be able to access the internet from the private EC2 instance.

#### Congratulations! You have successfully set up the NAT Gateway.
